**Instructions**

Since this project uses the fyrox engine, we need some commands to use the editor and engine properly.

 - *[ cargo run --package editor --release ]* : This command launches the editor with the game attached.
 - *[ cargo run --package executor --release ]* : This command builds the game in production and then runs it.
